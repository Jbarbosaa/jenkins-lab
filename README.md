🚀 Full Stack DevOps Lab – Ansible + AWS + Maven + Frontend + SES

This repo is a hands-on DevOps lab that ties together backend and frontend automation in one place. The goal is to practice full-stack deployment with real tools: infrastructure provisioned by Ansible, app running on AWS, backend built with Maven, frontend in PHP/HTML, database on MySQL, and notifications through Amazon SES.

🧰 Stack in Action

💻 Ansible – spin up and configure servers automatically

☁️ AWS (EC2, S3, SES) – host the app, store data, and send emails

🐬 MySQL – database for persistent data

🌐 HTML + PHP – simple frontend showing live DB info

☕ Java + Maven – backend packaged into a .jar

📧 Amazon SES – email alerts and status updates

🐙 Jenkins (optional) – CI/CD pipelines to tie it all together

🐳 Docker + Docker Compose – local isolated environments

🔐 IAM Roles & Policies – security setup on AWS

🔧 What it Does

🚀 Provision EC2 + MySQL + app stack with Ansible

🔄 Build and deploy backend with Maven

🌐 Frontend pulls dynamic data from MySQL

📤 SES sends emails for:

job success/failure

operation confirmations

💾 Backup jobs save data to S3

(Optional) Jenkins pipeline for full CI/CD flow
